# ThumpNail - YouTube Thumbnail Enhancer

ThumpNail is a single-page web application designed to empower YouTube creators by allowing them to generate enhanced, eye-catching thumbnails from a YouTube video URL. The primary goal is to provide a simple, intuitive interface for users to improve their video's click-through rate (CTR) with minimal effort.

## ‚ú® Features (Current & Planned)

*   **Input YouTube Video URL:** Easily paste a YouTube video link to get started.
*   **Generate Thumbnail:** A simple button to trigger the thumbnail enhancement process.
*   **Thumbnail Preview:** See the generated thumbnail directly in the app.
*   **Before & After Comparison:** Toggle between the original and enhanced thumbnail to see the improvements.
*   **Aesthetic Design:** A visually pleasing interface with dark mode support.
*   **(Future) Dynamic UI Adjustments:** Tools to add emojis, reposition text/buttons on the thumbnail.
*   **(Future) Watermark Removal via Sharing:** Share the app to remove any watermarks.
*   **(Future) Preloader:** Visual feedback during the thumbnail generation process.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Frontend Only - Initial Version)

This initial version focuses on the front-end user interface and interactivity. Backend functionality for actual thumbnail generation is planned for future integration.

To run this project locally (once the frontend is set up):

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd thumpnail
    ```
3.  Install dependencies (assuming a Node.js project, adjust as necessary):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application should then be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
